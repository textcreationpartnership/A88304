            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving by your la≈øt Letter, dated the 22. of this in≈øtant, received ≈øeverall papers inclo≈øed therein, touching your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent proceedings at <hi>London;</hi> all which I have ≈øeriou≈øly peru≈øed, and do render you many thanks for the ≈øame. And becau≈øe I am loth
<pb facs="tcp:160310:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 20 -->to ≈øhew my ≈øelf too much ungratefull, and leave you un≈øatisfied in your pre≈øent expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, I ≈øhall here, as briefly as po≈ø≈øibly I can, repre≈øent unto you ≈øome ≈ømall collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which I have lately drawn up, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the great and grand Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Army, a≈ø≈øented to by the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and ≈øouldiers under command of His Excellency Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> and ≈øent up to London by the Commi≈ø≈øioners, June 23 to bee communicated to the Honourable Hou≈øes of Parliament a≈ø≈øembled at We≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min≈øter, and the Lord Major and Court of Aldermen of the City of London.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherein is declared,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, the gallant expre≈ø≈øions of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall in the ≈øaid Declaration, ≈øhewing the Rea≈øons of their neerer approach towards the City of <hi>London,</hi> and that the Army hath voted (with one unanimous con≈øent) to have the Kings Maje≈øty conducted with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ≈øafety to <hi>Richmond,</hi> together with the Commi≈ø≈øioners, and the re≈øt of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants about the King; but hath declared again≈øt tho≈øe per≈øons, expre≈ø≈øed in the Votes
<pb facs="tcp:160310:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 20 -->of both hou≈øes of Parliament, for guarding of his Maje≈øties per≈øon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that having been lately infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of a malignant party within the City, who≈øe indeavours tended only for the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of di≈øcord, ca≈øting fal≈øe ≈øugge≈øtions and a≈øper≈øions upon the Army, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to make them odious to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that being ≈øen≈øible of the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the afore≈øaid party, and having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly di≈øcovered their private actions for contriving of a new war again≈øt this Army, who (by the Power of <hi>Heaven</hi>) hath beene the chiefe and in≈øtrumentall meanes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering the people of <hi>England</hi> from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall flavery; therefore, for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all con≈øpiracies and dangers that may ari≈øe, tending to the prejudice of the Peace of this Kingdome, it is declared in the name of the whole army, that they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øcend or yeeld to the votes of both Hou≈øes of Parliament, touching the Guard expre≈ø≈øed therein, but ≈øhall with all faithfulne≈ø≈øe and diligence endeavour to pre≈øerve his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øties

               <!-- PDF PAGE 21 -->Royall per≈øon from danger, and to that end hath appointed a competent number of faithfull, zealous, and religious men, cho≈øe out of ≈øeverall Regiments in the army, to guard and ≈øecure his Maje≈øties per≈øon at his Court at <hi>Richmond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, that the army is ≈øen≈øible of the great malice and inveteracy of divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons again≈øt them, who indeavour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve and embroyle this Nation in a new war, by which means, if once effected, would prove prejudiciall and de≈øtructive to the fundamental Lawes of this Kingdom, &amp; the liberty and propriety of the Subject.</p>

            <p>Sixthly, that ≈øo ≈øoon as they could have

               <!-- PDF PAGE 21 -->accompli≈øhed their wicked de≈øign, for ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of an Army on foot, their intents were to randezvouz near the City of <hi>Worce≈øter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, they further de≈øire that the Kings Maje≈øty may be re≈øtored to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Rights, and tryumphantly brought to his Royal Palace at White-hall.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, they profe≈ø≈øe and declare to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tizens of <hi>London,</hi> that they have no evill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent again≈øt them, neither will they injure any, either by ≈øtopping of provi≈øion, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of traffique, unle≈ø≈øe ehey be forced &amp; con≈øtrained thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All which fore going Rea≈øons are declared to be the chiefe cau≈øe of the Armies neare approach towards the City of London</hi>
